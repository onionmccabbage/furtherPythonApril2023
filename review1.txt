Beyond Advanced Python Review Exercise 1 (about 50-60 minutes)
========================================
Individually or in groups, tackle as many of these challenges as you like, in any order
There will be a chance to show your thinking after the exercise

Proxy Pattern
- Continue with the proxy example, to implement another 'payment' proxy, 
  such as a pre-paid foreign currency card

Decorator Pattern
- Write a decorator function that ensures all positional arguments are non-empty string
- expand this for other kinds of validation, and for keyword args

Facade and Factory patterns
- re-write the creature factory as a facade to all the creatures
- consider if the 'Manager' facade could be sensibly implemented as a factory

Command Pattern
- A stock can be 'shorted' (as well as buy/sell). Implement the basics of a 'short' command
- You could add a random feature for how much profit/loss a short stock makes
