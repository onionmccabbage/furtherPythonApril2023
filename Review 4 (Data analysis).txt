Review 4 (Data analysis)
========================
- read in external data into a data frame
- show the description
- show the dtypes
- find the mean flight time
‐ Group the data into separate data frames for each airline
‐ Show the minimum and mean departure delay for each airline
In the flights data set, find:
‐ The number of flight records
‐ The number of unique airlines
‐ How many unique aircraft are represented
‐ The greatest recorded delay (show the related data)
‐ The mean values for just the first 50 records in the dataset, then for all delays of 15 or more units

Consider how you can address the following challenges:
‐ On average, which airline is the most punctual
‐ Which airline arrives ahead of time most often
‐ Does flight duration appear to affect arrival punctuality more for some airlines than others
‐ Does time of day appear to affect departure punctuality across all flights
‐ Are the standard deviations of flight duration close to the standard deviations of flight distance
